1. npm install found 1 high severity vulnerability. 
-> Ran npm audit, webpack-dev-server: Missing Origin Validation 
-> ran npm install react-scripts@2.1.3 to resolve.
2. Ran npm start. Weather markers are in the wrong place. Location info shown on sidebar is correct, tried a few locations with latitude and longitude swapped on a map
-> Locations correlate with where the markers are currently. Rules out locationGetter, Sidebar 
-> changed App.js 52: const [lon, lat] to const [lat, lon] markers now displayed in correct Locations.

---Refactoring---
3. App.js line 33 useEffect function call contains a large function as a parameter, dislike in terms of readability and further refactoring
-> created separate function expression const fetchObservationLocations that does exactly the same, which is used as a parameter to useEffect call. 
4. Extracted map as class -> Mapping.js

---Improvements---
A. Created a new function on Mapping, updateMap, which takes the current center and zoom of the map and updates the maps state so that the map doesn't jump around as much.
