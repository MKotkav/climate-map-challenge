1. Fixes

1.1 npm install found 1 high severity vulnerability. 
-> Ran npm audit, webpack-dev-server: Missing Origin Validation 
-> ran npm install react-scripts@2.1.3 to resolve.
1.2 Ran npm start. Weather markers are in the wrong place. Location info shown on sidebar is correct, tried a few locations with latitude and longitude swapped on a map
-> Locations correlate with where the markers are currently. Rules out locationGetter, Sidebar 
-> changed App.js 52: const [lon, lat] to const [lat, lon] markers now displayed in correct Locations.
1.3 Location was being updated on the second click. 
-> As the locationId was already being passed as a props to Sidebar, removed the call to locationGetter.getSelectedLocatoinId as useless.
-> Did not remove locationGetter.js file, if there were other plans for it.

2. Refactoring
2.1 App.js line 33 useEffect function call contains a large function as a parameter, dislike in terms of readability and further refactoring
-> created separate function expression const fetchObservationLocations that does exactly the same, which is used as a parameter to useEffect call. 
2.2 Extracted map as class -> Mapping.js

3. Improvements
3.1 Created a new function on Mapping, updateMap, which takes the current center and zoom of the map and updates the maps state so that the map doesn't jump around as much.
