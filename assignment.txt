1. npm install found 1 high severity vulnerability. -> Ran npm audit, webpack-dev-server: Missing Origin Validation -> ran npm install react-scripts@2.1.3 to resolve.
2. ran npm start. Weather markers are in the wrong place. Location info shown on sidebar is correct, tried a few locations with latitude and longitude swapped on a map
-> Locations correlate with where the markers are currently. Rules out locationGetter, Sidebar -> changed App.js 52: const [lon, lat] to const [lat, lon] which fixed the problem.
